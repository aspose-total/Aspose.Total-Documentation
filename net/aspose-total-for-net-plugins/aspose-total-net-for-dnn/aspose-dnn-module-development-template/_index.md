## **Using**
Once you’ve installed the templates, you can set up a project based on them. To do so you should follow the steps below. Before you can use them, you should have installed Visual Studio 2010, 2012 or 2013 and Aspose DotNetNuke Project Templates (described above).

1. Set up the DotNetNuke Development environment following the steps in the Wiki (the templates assume you have your development environment set up at <http://dnndev.me/>). [Development Environment](http://www.dnnsoftware.com/Resources/Wiki/page/development-environment.aspx)
1. Run Visual Studio 2010, 2012 or 2013 as an Administrator (right-click the desk-top shortcut to do so)
1. From the **File** menu, select **New Project**.
1. Choose either C# or VB.Net from the Languages section of the new project dialog. 

![todo:image_alt_text](aspose-dnn-module-development-template_3)

1. Select the DotNetNuke Folder under your preferred language (C# or Visual Basic).
1. Choose either the **Aspose DotNetNuke C# Compiled Module** or **Aspose DotNetNuke 7 C# DAL2 Compiled Module** template for your project template (or the VB.NET versions).
1. For the new project creation screen using the following settings 
   1. Name: ModuleName
      Something unique here, example DNNTaskManager
   1. Location: c:\websites\dnndev.me\desktopmodules\
      This assumes you set up your development environment as instructed in step 1.
   1. Solution: Create new solution
   1. Create directory for solution : **Unchecked** 
      If checked, this option will cause path problems. The templates assume that the SLN is in the same folder as the project file.
   1. Click **OK**.

A screen is shown containing all Aspose components (screenshot below).

\1. Select one or more components from the list. Each component’s common uses is shown upon selection.
\2. Click **Next** to continue once done.

![todo:image_alt_text](aspose-dnn-module-development-template_2)

The Next screen shows the download progress for each selected component. 

![todo:image_alt_text](aspose-dnn-module-development-template_5)

Once the downloading is completed the module is created with the selection components automatically reference. 

![todo:image_alt_text](aspose-dnn-module-development-template_6)

This creates a folder under c:\websites\dnndev.me\desktopmodules\ModuleName which should contain all the files necessary for your module, including the solution.

There are a couple of final steps just to finalize the process, documented in the **Documentation\Documentation.html** file, which should open up automatically in Visual Studio after the project is created. Follow the steps to configure the final project properties and then you are ready to build/deploy a module. You can delete the documentation folder once you have completed those steps.
## **Video Demo**
Please check [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuni9D9vPEI) below to see the module in action.
## **Support, Extend and Contribute**
### **Support**
From the very first days of Aspose, we knew that just giving our customers good products would not be enough. We also needed to deliver good service. We are developers ourselves and understand how frustrating it is when a technical issue or a quirk in the software stops you from doing what you need to do. We're here to solve problems, not create them.

This is why we offer free support. Anyone who uses our product, whether they have bought them or are using an evaluation, deserves our full attention and respect.
