- Aspose New Project creates a new project by downloading and referencing libraries of Aspose Java APIs.
- Aspose New Project wizard allows you to select components from Aspose Java product lines like Aspose.Cells for Java and Aspose.Words for Java.
- Once specific API is selected, its reference is automatically downloaded from Aspose servers and referenced in the classpath of the project.
- Once the project is created using **New Project -> Java -> Aspose Application**, the user can then add Aspose samples using **New File -> Java -> Aspose Example**.
- Available samples are displayed in tree format from where the user can select one.
- Selected samples will be added to the current project including source files and required data files.
- The newly created project is ready to debug/evaluate, all references are automatically added.
