## **Aspose.Total Java for Apache POI**
Project Aspose for Apache POI shows how different functionalities can be achieved using Aspose Java APIs in comparison with Apache POI.

The developers looking for file format libraries may need to walk through the features provided by the libraries available on the market. Mainly, two factors are considered when choosing an option:

- Features
- Efforts required using the library

If you are a Java developer looking to choose a file format library to process files, you may want to compare Apache POI SDK with Aspose. In this case, this project will help you to compare features and code in both libraries.

Following comparison examples are available through Aspose.Total Java for IntelliJ Plugin Aspose Example wizard:

- Aspose.Words Java for Apache POI (HWPF + XWPF)
- Aspose.Cells Java for Apache POI SS (HSSF + XSSF)
- Aspose.Slides Java for Apache POI (HSLF + XSLF)

These examples can be used in a native way like creating simple Java Application and Java File.

Please follow the detailed steps for using the Aspose Example Wizard as mentioned below.
