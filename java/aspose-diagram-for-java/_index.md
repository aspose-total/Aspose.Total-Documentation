Aspose.Diagram is the most flexible and reliable API that allows Java Applications to create and manage Microsoft Office Visio drawings without requiring Microsoft Office Visio to be installed on the system. It provides better performance and is easier to use to manipulate diagrams and convert files than Microsoft Office Automation.

Aspose.Diagram takes advantage of advanced functionality provided by Visio services to manipulate Visio documents on a server. Aspose.Diagram API is extensible, easy to use, compact and provides all the most common functionality so that developers can write less code.
