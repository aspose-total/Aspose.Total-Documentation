**Welcome to Aspose.Tasks for Java!**

Aspose.Tasks for Java is a class library that enables Java application developers to embed the functionality of processing Microsoft Project ® documents (MPP/MPT/XLS) without even using Microsoft Project®. The API, hence, eliminates the requirement of Microsoft Office Automation in such application. Ported from its equivalent .NET product, Aspose.Tasks for Java is a mature product that offers stability and flexibility. The component provides an easy to use API for manipulating project files, saving time and money compared to developing similar features from scratch.
